This is an unofficial fork of Mini-OS, a small operating system kernel that
runs as a Xen guest. Mini-OS is part of Xen [1], but for convenience the
non-Mini-OS parts have been deleted for this release.

This fork contains various experimental patches. It:

- adds support for ARM processors,
- can be used as a library (libminios.a), and
- exposes extra features needed by Mirage [2].

To install:

  cd extras/mini-os
  make
  sudo make install

Certain files in the extras/mini-os directory are licensed by the GNU General
Public License version 2 (GPLv2). By default these files are not built and
linked into MiniOs. Enabling them will cause the whole work to become covered
by the GPLv2.
